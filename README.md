# Machine Learning Basics
This repository provides a brief overview of fundamental machine learning model. These models are building block of many advanced machine learning applications.

## Linear Regression
Linear regression is a basic supervised learning model used for regression tasks. It models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. The goal is to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values.
In simple linear regression, there's one independent variable, while in multiple linear regression, there are multiple independent variables. This model is commonly used for tasks like predicting house prices, stock prices, or any continuous numerical value.

## Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is another essential supervised learning model, but it's used for classification tasks. It models the probability of a binary outcome (0 or 1) based on one or more predictor variables. The output is transformed using the logistic function, which maps any real-valued number to a value between 0 and 1, making it suitable for binary classification.

Logistic regression is widely used in tasks like spam detection, credit scoring, and medical diagnosis.
